In the process of finding a good solution for ConDep's documentation, we ended up replacing the entire con-dep.net web site with a Jekyll based solution hosted on GitHub. We found this works really well for this project. Both that the entire site is source controlled, and the focus on HTML and Markdown instead of the previous WordPress publishing workflow. This has the added benefit of making it a lot easier to document the project going forward and easier for contributors to participate. You can now for instance create a pull request for a change in the documentation, and we can easily give committers direct access to change the site.

We hope you share our view and like the new site!
