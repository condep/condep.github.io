A group of people interested in open source and committed to ConDep have created a [ConDep user group in Bergen, Norway](http://www.meetup.com/ConDepBergen/). Their first meeting is [Tuesday 29th of March](http://www.meetup.com/ConDepBergen/events/229709233/), so join them if you live around Bergen and want to participate in a open source project. This is the first ConDep user group ever created. Congrats!
