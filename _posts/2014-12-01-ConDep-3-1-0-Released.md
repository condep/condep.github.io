ConDep version 3.1.0 is now available on NuGet and we're officially out of Beta! The [documentation](/docs) still needs some more work, but new content gets added every day. Thanks to everyone who have reported bugs and helped making ConDep to what it is today. We are looking forward to your feedback and suggestions.

Going forward the public NuGet feed will only contain public releases and no Beta or PreReleases anymore. Those will be published to MyGet under this feed: [https://www.myget.org/F/condep/](https://www.myget.org/F/condep/). So if you want to use these, just add that feed to your local NuGet feed list.
