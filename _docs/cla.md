Contributor License Agreement
=============================

In order to clarify the intellectual property rights in the project, and to grant licenses to the project to others, ConDep requires that you accept this Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”). This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ConDep, its users, and its licensees; you may still license your own Contributions under other terms.

If you have any questions regarding this agreement, please use this contact form.

###Please read the contributor license and sign electronically by filling out the form below.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to ConDep. Except for the license granted herein to ConDep and recipients of software distributed by ConDep, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. _Definitions._<br>
   “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with ConDep. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or<br>   
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or<br>   
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br><br>
   “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship or invention, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to ConDep for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by ConDep (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to ConDep or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, ConDep for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

2. _Grant of Copyright License._<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ConDep and to recipients of software distributed by ConDep a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, as well as the right to sublicense and have sublicensed all of the foregoing rights, through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

3. _Grant of Patent License._<br>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ConDep and to recipients of software distributed by ConDep a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. _Legally entitled_<br>
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your contributions to ConDep, or that your employer has executed with ConDep a separate contributor license agreement substantially similar to this Agreement.

5. _Your original creation_<br>
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. _Not expected to provide support_<br>
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

7. _Work that is not Your original creation_<br>
Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to ConDep separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Not a Contribution. Third-party materials licensed pursuant to: [license name(s) here]” (substituting the bracketed text with the appropriate license name(s)).

8. You agree to notify ConDep of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
