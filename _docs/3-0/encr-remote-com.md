## PowerShell Remoting
ConDep use PowerShell Remoting for most of its work except transferring files (which 
uses the ConDep Node). Underneath PowerShell Remoting is WinRM, a Web Service for for 
remote interaction with Windows computers. 

Before we go into encryption, lets just take a look at authentication. WinRM supports 
6 authentication protocols:

* Basic
* Digest
* Kerberos (Default when client is in a Domain)
* Negotiate (either Kerberos or NTLM - Default when client is NOT in a Domain)
* Certificate
* CredSSP (See own section below)

For security reasons, ConDep only supports PowerShell's default authentication. Default 
in PowerShell means **Kerberos** if both computers are within a Domain, or **Negotiate** 
if not. **Negotate** will allow the two computers to settle on the strongest authentication 
they can both agree on (Kerberos or NTLM version x). ConDep also support **CredSSP**, which 
is covered in a separate section below.

So back to the reason for bringing up authentication.

<div class="note info">
	<h2>PowerShell encrypt HTTP traffic</h2>
  <p>
		As long as <b>Kerberos</b> or <b>Negotiate</b> is in use, PowerShell will encrypt the 
    traffic even when using plain HTTP (no SSL).
	</p>
</div>

Since ConDep don't allow you to specify authentication type, traffic will always be encrypted.

<div class="note warning">
	<h2>When using ConDep outside a Windows Domain, we recommend using SSL</h2>
  <p>
  	Even though traffic will be encrypted through PowerShell, the authenticity of the 
    remote computer cannot be guarantied when both or one of the computers are NOT in a 
    Windows Domain.
	</p>
</div>

To tell ConDep to use SSL, set `"SSL" : "true"` for the remote computer in the 
environment file:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "Servers" :
  [
    {
      "Name" : "ec2-54-216-139-21.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
      "SSL" : "true"
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you still decide against using SSL, you will have to add the remote computer to 
WinRM's `TrustedHosts` list.

To do this using `winrm.exe` on your client:

{% highlight console %}
winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="RemoteComputer#1, RemoteComputer#2, etc"}'
{% endhighlight %}

To do this using `PowerShell` on your client:

{% highlight powershell %}
Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value 'RemoteComputer#1, RemoteComputer#2, etc'
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, and really **NOT recommended**, you could trust **ALL**:
{% highlight console %}
winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="*"}'
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight powershell %}
Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value '*'
{% endhighlight %}

## <a name="node"></a>ConDep Node
ConDep Node is a self hosted HTTP Web API running as a Windows Service on all remote 
servers ConDep communicate with. ConDep automatically deploys the Node the first time 
it talks to a new server, and keeps it updated with the latest version used by the client. 
The node (or service) does not run on the servers unless ConDep is executing remote 
operations on it.

The node by default runs over SSL on port 4444. If you need to change the port you can 
do this either from the command line when executing condep.exe (using `--nodePort=VALUE`) 
or set it on individual servers in your `env.json` file. The server setting in `env.json` 
has precedence over what you pass in on the command line, but ...
