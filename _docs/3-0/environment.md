Environment Configuration
=========================

Environment files in ConDep is where you put your environment specific configurations. Are the web servers in your test environment named differently from production? Is the server names the same, but FQDN difers? Different Load Balancer? Different admin credentials (I would hope so!)?

If you have three environments you commonly refer to as Dev, Test and Prod - you would create three environment configuration files:

* `dev.env.json`
* `test.env.json`
* `prod.env.json`

HereÂ´s a environment file (`prod.env.json`) example:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "Servers" :
  [
    {
      "Name" : "web01.prod.local"
    },
    {
      "Name" : "web02.prod.local"
    },
    {
      "Name" : "web03.prod.local"
    }
  ],
  "DeploymentUser": 
  {
    "UserName": "Administrator",
    "Password": "ReallySecureP@$$w0rd :-)"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`condep.exe` takes several mandatory parameters, one which is the environment name. Note that you only use the name, excluding .env.json.

## Tiers

To differentiate between environments is great, but what about Tiers? You probably have servers in your environments which you can categorize into different Tiers. Common Tiers would be a Web-Tier, an App-Tier and a Data-Tier. It's up to you what you call them and how many you have.

Here's a environment file (`prod.env.json`) with Tiers example:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "Tiers":
  [
    {
      "Name" : "Web",
      "Servers" :
      [
        {
          "Name" : "web01.prod.local"
        },
        {
          "Name" : "web02.prod.local"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name" : "App",
      "Servers" :
      [
        {
          "Name" : "app01.prod.local"
        },
        {
          "Name" : "app02.prod.local"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name" : "Data",
      "Servers" :
      [
        {
          "Name" : "data01.prod.local"
        },
        {
          "Name" : "data02.prod.local"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "DeploymentUser": 
  {
    "UserName": "Administrator",
    "Password": "ReallySecureP@$$w0rd :-)"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You don't pass the tier to `condep.exe` as you do with the environment name, you use a .NET attribute on you Artifact instead. You can find out more about how you do this under [Artifacts](../artifacts/)
