ConDep will validate client and server PowerShell versions, and that it can remotely 
communicate with the configured servers before doing any actual work on them. It will 
**not**, however, validate operating system versions as defined in the General 
requirements below. Some [Operations](../condep-dsl-operations/) might work on OS 
versions lower than the recommended, but not all.

Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 are enabled for Windows PowerShell Remoting by default.
If the settings are changed, you can restore the default settings by by running the 
`Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet.

On all other supported versions of Windows, you need to run the `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet 
to enable Windows PowerShell Remoting.

In addition, Windows Remote Management (WinRM) must be enabled on both client 
and servers. You can find more information about enabling WinRM from this Microsoft 
article: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555966](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555966)

## Firewalls and Ports
From Microsoft ( [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85) ):

> Starting in WinRM 2.0, the default listener ports configured by `winrm
> quickconfig` are port 5985 for HTTP transport and port 5986 for HTTPS.
> WinRM listeners can be configured on any arbitrary port.


> If a computer is upgraded to WinRM 2.0, the previously configured
> listeners are migrated and still receive traffic.

The ConDep [Node](../security/#node) by default listens on TCP port 4444 using SSL.

## Credentials

To create remote sessions and run remote commands, by default, the current
user must be a member of the **Administrators** group on the remote computer or
provide the credentials of an **Administrator**. Otherwise, the command will fail.
